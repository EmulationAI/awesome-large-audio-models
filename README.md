# <p align=center>`Awesome Large Language Models in Audio Signal Processing`</p>

A curated list of awesome large language models in audio signal processing (**in chronological order**), inspired by the other awesome-initiatives. We intend to regularly update the relevant latest papers and their open-source implementations on this page. 

We strongly encourage the researchers that want to promote their fantastic work to the community to make pull request to update their paper's information!
